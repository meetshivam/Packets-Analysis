# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

[![Wireshark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Wireshark-blue)](https://www.wireshark.org/)

This repository contains the results and analysis of a **network traffic investigation** conducted on the Wikipedia and Galgotias University websites. The primary goal of this project was to capture and analyze network packets to understand communication protocols and gain hands-on experience with Wireshark.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used **Wireshark** to capture live network traffic from my local machine while accessing Wikipedia and the Galgotias University website. The captured data was analyzed to explore various protocol layers and understand the sequence of operations during a typical web browsing session.

This exercise provided practical insights into how real-world networks operate and how different protocols interact.

## Key Skills and Competencies

* **Network Packet Analysis:** Capture, filter, and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
* **Protocol Analysis:**

  * **DNS:** Examine DNS queries and responses to understand domain name resolution.
  * **TCP:** Analyze the TCP three-way handshake, sequence and acknowledgment numbers, and connection termination.
  * **HTTP:** Inspect GET/POST requests, response codes, and data transfer.
* **Network Troubleshooting:** Identify network anomalies and potential issues through packet-level inspection.
* **Wireshark Expertise:** Create display filters, follow TCP streams, and identify protocol hierarchies for efficient analysis.

## Experience and Learning

This project provided a comprehensive learning experience, bridging theoretical networking knowledge with practical application. By dissecting real-world network traffic, I was able to:

* Visualize the **OSI model in action** by observing encapsulation and de-encapsulation across different protocol layers.
* Gain a deeper understanding of **web browser and server communication**.
* Develop **critical thinking and problem-solving skills** by analyzing complex network interactions.
* Enhance knowledge of **network security principles** by observing unencrypted data transfers.

This hands-on experience has solidified my understanding of networking concepts and equipped me with practical skills to analyze and troubleshoot network issues in real-world scenarios.
